Test of using std::mdspan to iterate over 2d data. 
In an earlier version of this test which read data primarily sequentially, using std::mdspan was for me much slower than using std::vector<std::vector<T>>. 
In my head, it should have been faster, as it is just a view of a std::vector<T>, which will have contiguous memory (not guaranteed for a vector of vectors). Changing to reading a Moore neighborhood, where the reads are often non-sequential, has all of the containers working faster than std::vector<std::vector<T>> as you would expect in a textbook case. Interestingly, direct std::vector<int> access was faster than either mdspan or Eigen::Matrix, and the latter two performed about the same on my machine. The difference is quite small though, so I think in most cases I would prefer Eigen::Matrix due to all of the other things it offers. At least using msvc, the implementation is not fully consistent with the standards (specifically with how the [] operator works), making I think Eigen::Matrix have the nicest code in terms of readability. The need to pass in a std::array with mdspan (which doesn't conform to the reference examples) makes the code a little ugly. I would have expected Eigen::Matrix to actually perform the best as it does some tricky things under the hood that are above my paygrade to implement.
